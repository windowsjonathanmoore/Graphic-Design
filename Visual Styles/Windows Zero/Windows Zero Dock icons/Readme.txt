ObjectDock Plus 1.90 [April 2007]
    Windows 2000/XP/Vista or later required
    Enhanced version for registered users - DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

    news://news.stardock.com/stardock.objectdock
------------------------------------------------

Thousands of icons, images, and zoomers are
available free from http://www.WinCustomize.com.
Be sure to checkout the docklets there as well!

Note: system tray icon usage is not supported on
x64 versions of Windows.

See SkinningTheDock.txt for information on creating
new tabs and looks.


-------------------------
Basic instructions / FAQ:
-------------------------

- Right click items on the dock to customize them

- Files and folders can be dragged onto the dock to create
new items. This includes special folders like "My Computer".

- You can drag items off the dock to delete them or right-click
on them to delete via menu.

- Click the "Configure ObjectDock" item or right-click a blank
area of the dock to access Dock Properties.

- ObjectDock can read PNG image files, as well as 32-bit icon
files in both Windows XP and Windows 2000. Images to be used
in items can be put anywhere off the ObjectDock folder. ObjectDock
will search its folders and all of its subfolders of it for images.
It is recommended that you use subfolders to categorize your images,
like the included Crystallized and LaST subdirs under the
Images directory.

- The Windows taskbar can be turned on or off via the dock settings dialog.

- Images can be assigned to windows based on the .EXE that they are running
or the "class name" for the window. The more specific class name takes
priority over the program file name in the event images have been set to both.
(e.g. one for the mail program, and another for an email window)

- The dock will track mouse movement even if another window is maximized
over the dock.

- Using the Windows shortcut objects to hide open windows and show the desktop
will also hide tabbed docks. If the tabbed docks are set to "always on top"
or "always on bottom", there is a setting under the Advanced Options to
modify this behavior.

- You can configure ObjectDock via command line arguments. Replace n with a
number (see descriptions for info) for the new status desired:

objectdock.exe -ahn  (turn on/off autohide, n=0-off, n=1-on, n=2-toggle)
objectdock.exe -psn (side position, n=0-bottom 1-top, 2-left, 3-right)
objectdock.exe -pan (alignment position, n=1-left(top) 2-middle 3-right(bottom))
objectdock.exe -mn (turn on/off mouse effect (magnification), n=0-off, n=1-on, n=2-toggle)

- ObjectDock includes options to adjust the position of the dock, its alignment,
z-order (normal, always on top, always on bottom), zoomer sizes, zoomer effects,
and much much more!

- Have fun!



---------------
Obligatory bits
---------------

ObjectDock Plus incorporates decompression code by the Info-ZIP group.

There are no extra charges or costs due to the use of this code,
and the original compression sources are freely available from
ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/ on the Internet. We will also,
upon request, mail you the full sources on a 3.5" MSDOS-formatted
diskette for the cost of mailing.

The full source of the InfoZip compressor/decompressor can also
be obtained from ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/archiving/zip/.

Thanks to Jairo Boudewyn for the great looking ObjectDock icon as
well as a search image. Thank your frogsgs for another image as well.

Permission was given from Everaldo, the author of the
Crystallized icon set, for the icons to be included with ObjectDock.

excellent artwork!

Credits for the Crystallized icon set porting go to:
Funkware-DJP (http://funkware.da.ru) for his "Crystal" icon set
port and Bryan King for his "Crystal 1.0 Beta" port. Icons from
both packages were used.
