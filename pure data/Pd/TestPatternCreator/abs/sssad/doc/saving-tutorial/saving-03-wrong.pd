#X text 22 26 But first lets think about another problem: What happens
\, if we want to use our state saving enabled patch itself as an abstraction
and we want to use this abstraction several times \, each time with
its own state. wrong.pd shows \, that this won't work: For one \, we
cannot save this abstraction without opening it \, and second: We can
still only save one set of state variables:;
#X text 33 280 As soon as you save one of the "wrong" instances \,
the other one will take over its values.;
#X text 32 328 Now we could again move out our message boxes \, place
them in the parent patch connected through an inlet and outlet \, but
this would just be a temporary fix: As soon as we wanted to use the
parent as an abstraction again \, we would face the same issue again!

#X text 31 415 So we need a different strategy. Read on.;
