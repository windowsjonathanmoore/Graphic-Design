I'm still removing the github references.

The books I learned Data Structures and Algorigthms was "An Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein"
From M.I.T. available here: https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms

and

"The Art of Computer Programming Volumes 1-4A Box Set". Fascicles 4A are is to me. https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Programming-Volumes-1-4A-Boxed/dp/0321751043

by Donald Knuth

Also the GNU MIX development kit http://www.gnu.org/software/mdk/mdk.html

You can build the MIX Builder with Lazarus http://www.lazarus-ide.org/
