; Layer Instruments
; ----------------
; Dynamically add or remove layers of the same instrument
; layers can be identified in the called instrument via a counter in their p4: 1,2,3,4 ...
;
; LayerInstruments  klayers,iInstr,idur
; 
; Initialisation
; --------------
; iInstr --  the number of the instrument to be called
; idur   --  the duration of the instrument to be called
;
; Performance
; -----------
; klayers--  number of instrument layers required
;            changing klayers will automatically stop all instances of the instrumnt currently playing and start the new required number
;            only integers are relevant and negative numbers are interpretted as zeroes
