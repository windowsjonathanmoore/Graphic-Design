; Performance
; -----------
; ain    --  input audio to be filtered
; ksens  --  sensitivity of the envelope follower (suggested range: 0 to 1)
; kfreq  --  base frequency of the filter before modulation by the input dynamics (range: 0 to 1)
; kres   --  resonance of the lowpass filter (suggested range: 0 to 0.99)
