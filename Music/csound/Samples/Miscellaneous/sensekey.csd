sensekey.csd
WRITTEN BY IAIN MCCURDY, 2011

This example demonstrates the 'sensekey' opcode which senses key presses on the computer's keyboard and outputs 
the decimal value.
To be able to use key presses we will need to know their decimal values. 
These can be found online in an ascii table (http://www.asciitable.com/)
or they can be output to the terminal by uncommenting a line in instr 1.
Note that the ascii codes of certain keys (for example the cursor keys) differ from platform to platform.
Using 'or' ('||') enquiries in the conditional interrogations can accomodate cross-platform compatibility.

Note that the terminal window will need to be in focus for key presses to be sensed, for this reason no fltk is used in this example.
to sense key presses when an FLTK window is in focus use the 'FLkeyin' opcode.

'sensekey' does behave slightly differently to 'FLkeyin' however. 
'sensekey' follows each key press value with a '-1', but keypress values are reiterated according to repeat-key 
settings made in the computer's operating system.
Each subsequent iteraction is again followed immediately with a '-1'.
'FLkeyin' reiterates each value upon each k-cycle.

sensekey is case sensitive.
