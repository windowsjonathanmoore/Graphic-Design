Dear CsoundForLive Full Collection Updaters

Here are some additional installation instructions:

MacUsers

The plugins no longer have csound~ embedded in them, and so....
- You need to install csound~ 

If you have yet to manually install the csound~ external, you should
download the most recent csound~ from http://davixology.com/csound~.html

- Max5 Users: 
use the automated installer and choose the "doubles" version.

- Max6 Users (or recent purchasers of the Full Collection): 
a. unarchive "csound~_v1.1.0.zip"
b. copy the file "csound~_double.mxo" into the folder:
       /Applications/Max6/Cycling '74/msp-externals 
c. rename the file from "csound~_double.mxo" to "csound~.mxo"

PcUsers
You have probably already installed csound~ and so, you should be OK.

Dr.B.
