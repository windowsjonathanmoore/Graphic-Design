<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Tahoma, sans-serif">This
instrument implements an arpeggiator effect, such as is often found
on hardware synthesizers. The notes generated by the arpeggiator are
played by a simple synthesizer and echoed by a multi-mode delay.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Tahoma, sans-serif">The
speed or rate of the arpeggio is defined using the 'Tempo' knob in
BPM (beats per minute). Each arpeggio note is assumed to be a
quaver/eighth note so a tempo of 120 BPM will result in 240 notes
being played per minute, assuming beats are crotchets/quarter notes.
There are also 8 'multiplier' presets which scale the tempo using
simple ratios. There are six modes of movement: 'Up', 'Down', and 'Up
and Down' are as would be expected. 'Random Direction' randomly moves
up or down from the current pitch to the next pitch in the arpeggio.
'Random Pick' chooses any other note within the arpeggio each time a
new note is required. 'Seq. Play' plays through the sequence of notes
in the order in which they were pressed. 'Cycles' will add repeats of
the entire arpeggio transposed sequentially by the number of
semitones defined by 'Intvl'. 'Cycles' will have no effect if 'Intvl'
is zero. If 'Intvl' is negative subsequent cycles of the arpeggio
will be lower than the first. If 'Up+Down' is activated the
transposition steps will go up and then back down (or vice versa if
'Intvl' is negative) rather than just in a single direction before
repeating. This option is ignored in 'Random Dir.' mode which instead
implements a kind of 'Drunken Walk'. 'Hold' imitates the action of a
keyboard's sustain pedal. This function is also sometimes referred to
as 'latch' in arpeggiators. 'Swing' warps the rhythm of each pair of
arpeggiator notes. The rhythm is warped continuously from
quaver:quaver at its minimum setting to dotted-quaver:semiquaver at
its maximum. At its midway point the rhythm is
triplet-crotchet:triplet quaver.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Tahoma, sans-serif">The
synthesizer is a single oscillator synthesizer with four waveform
choices, an amplitude envelope, a filter envelope and an LFO which
influences the filter cutoff frequency. The filter envelope can be
defined as a static repeating function ('Kybd.Track' off) or one that
describes a frequency function relative to the currently playing
pitch ('Kybd.Track' on). The filter can be either resonant lowpass or
bandpass. Increasing 'Port.' applies an increasing sliding portamento
between pitch changes.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Tahoma, sans-serif">'Freq.Shift'
frequency shifts the synthesizer tone by the number of cycles per
second defined by the 'Freq.' knob. When 'Freq' is zero the effect is
bypassed.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Tahoma, sans-serif">A
ping-pong delay, the delay time of which is defined as the number of
beats at the current tempo, can be introduced by raising the level
control. When 'level' is zero the effect is bypassed.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Tahoma, sans-serif">Whenever
a new note is played its note number is written into two different
function tables: in the first table, note numbers are written
sequentially in the order in which they were played. (NB. if a note
is removed its note number is removed from this table and any notes
following it in the table are shunted back one place so as to not
leave any gaps.) This table is used by the 'Seq. Play' and 'Random
Pick' arpeggiator modes. A second table is created (and updated any
time a new note is added or removed) in which all notes currently
being held are sorted into ascending order. This table is used by all
other arpeggiator modes. A third table is used to store the on/off
status of each note. A value of '1' in this table denotes 'note on'
and '0' denotes 'note off'. For example if middle C (note number 60)
is pressed, the 61st table item with index number 60 will be '1'.
This is needed to check for active notes and prevent the same note
appearing twice in a note row. This would otherwise be possible when
'hold' is active. This function could be deactivated if you wanted to
define arpeggios with repeated notes.</FONT></P>
