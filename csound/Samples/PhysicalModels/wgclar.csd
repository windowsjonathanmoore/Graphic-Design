;Written by Iain McCurdy, 2006

;DEMONSTRATION OF THE wgclar OPCODE. THIS IS A PHYSICALLY MODELLED CLARINET - SOUNDS MORE LIKE PAN PIPES AT TIMES... YUCK!
;	- THE ALGORITHM USED IS SIMILAR TO THAT USED BY THE wgflute OPCODE

;kamp - AMPLITUDE

;kfreq - THE FUNDEMENTAL OF THE TONE PRODUCED

;kstiff - THE STIFFNESS OF THE REED - BUT I CAN'T GET IT TO DO ANYTHING! CAN YOU PROVE ME WRONG?

;iatt/idek - ATTACK AND DECAY TIMES.
;	NOTE THAT THESE CONTROLS WILL IMPLEMENT AN ATTACK AND DECAY CHARACTERISTIC THAT IS MORE ELABORATE 
;	-THAN JUST AN AMPLITUDE ENVELOPE STYLE ATTACK AND DECAY
;	IN ORDER FOR THE DECAY TIME PARAMETER TO WORK PROPERLY NOTE DURATION MUST BE EXTENDED.
;	IN A MIDI SITUATION THIS COULD BE DONE USING linenr, linsegr OR expsegr.

;kngain - AMPLITUDE OF BREATH/WIND NOISE. THE FLUTE SOUND CONSISTS OF 2 MAIN ELEMENTS:
;	THE RESONANT TONE AND THE BREATH NOISE. 
;	THIS PARAMETER CONTROLS THE STRENGTH OF THE BREATH/WIND NOISE.
;	A USEFUL RANGE FOR THIS IS ABOUT 0-1
;	0=NO BREATH NOISE, 1=BREATH NOISE ONLY

;kvibf/kvibamp - THIS OPCODE IMPLEMENTS VIBRATO THAT GOES BEYOND JUST FREQUENCY MODULATION AND INCLUDES MODULATION 
;	-UPON SEVERAL OTHER ASPECTS OF THE SOUND INCLUDING AMPLITUDE MODULATION
;	A USEFUL RANGE FOR kvibamp (AMPLITUDE OF VIBRATO) IS 0-.25 WHERE 0=NO VIBRATO AND .25=A LOT OF VIBRATO
;	kvibf IS USED TO CONTROL VIBRATO FREQUENCY, A NATURAL VIBRATO FREQUENCY IS ABOUT 5 HZ

;ifn - A FUNCTION TABLE WAVEFORM MUST BE GIVEN TO DEFINE THE SHAPE OF THE VIBRATO, 
;	-THIS SHOULD NORMALLY BE A SINE WAVE.

;THE OPCODE OFFERS 3 FURTHER *OPTIONAL* PARAMETERS:

;iminfreq - A MINIMUM FREQUENCY SETTING GIVEN TO THE ALGORITHM
;	- TYPICALLY THIS IS SET TO A VALUE BELOW THE FREQUENCY SETTING GIVEN BY kfreq
;	- IF kfreq GOES BELOW iminfreq IS CAN HAVE A STRANGE EFFECT ON THE SOUND AND THE SETTING FOR kfreq NO LONGER 
;	-REFLECTS THE PITCH THAT IS ACTUALLY HEARD.
