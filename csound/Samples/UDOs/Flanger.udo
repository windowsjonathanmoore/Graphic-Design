; Flanger
; ----------------
; A flanger effect following the typical design of a so called 'stomp box'
;
; aout  Flanger  ain,krate,kdepth,kdelay,kfback
;
; Performance
; -----------
; ain    --  input audio to which the flanging effect will be applied
; krate  --  rate control of the lfo of the effect *NOT IN HERTZ* (range 0 to 1)
; kdepth --  depth of the lfo of the effect (range 0 to 1)
; kdelay --  static delay offset of the flanging effect (range 0 to 1)
; kfback --  feedback and therefore intensity of the effect (range 0 to 1)
